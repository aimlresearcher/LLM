## 🤖 What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to **deep learning models** that can create high-quality content such as:

- 📝 Text
- 🖼️ Images
- 🔊 Audio
- 🕹️ 3D objects
- 🎵 Music

These models are trained to **understand patterns** in data and use that understanding to **generate new, relevant content**.

> 🎨 Think of generative AI like an artist who studies hundreds of paintings and creates original artwork inspired by what they’ve learned.

## 🧠 Types of Generative AI Models

### 📝 **Text Generation**
- Understands relationships between words and generates **contextually relevant content**
- 🌍 Can translate text across languages while preserving tone
- ✨ **Example:** Writing the next sentence in a story or translating English to French
- 📌 **Model:** *Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)*

---

### 🖼️ **Image Generation**

Two main methods:
1. **Text-to-image**: Converts text prompts to images  
   - 🖼️ *Example:* "A robot playing the piano"  
   - 🔧 **Model:** *DALL·E*
2. **Image-to-image**: Uses seed images or random noise to create new visuals  
   - 🎭 *Example:* Deepfakes, photo-realistic images from sketches  
   - 🧪 **Models:** *GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)*, *Diffusion Models*

---

### 🔊 **Audio Generation**
- Generates **natural-sounding speech** or converts **text to speech**
- 🗣️ *Example:* Creating a realistic-sounding conversation
- 📌 **Model:** *WaveNet*
